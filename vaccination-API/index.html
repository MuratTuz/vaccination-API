      <h2>COVID-19 VACCINATION</h2>
      <h1>General information on the COVID-19 vaccination</h1>

      <h3>Is the vaccination safe and effective?</h3>
      <p>
        Since every vaccine in Switzerland must be authorised, it has to meet
        stringent safety, efficacy and quality requirements. Swissmedic, the
        Swiss Agency for Therapeutic Products, has carefully assessed and
        authorised the mRNA vaccines against COVID-19. They are safe and
        effective. Several tens of thousands of people have received the
        vaccines in clinical trials. They are also safe and effective for the
        elderly and those with chronic illnesses.Since their approval, hundreds
        of millions of people have received these vaccines. Experts will
        continue to monitor the safety and efficacy of the vaccines. The
        benefits of a vaccine must significantly outweigh the risks. Only then
        will the vaccine be recommended in Switzerland.
