    <h2>COVID-19 VACCINATION</h2>
    <h1>General information on the COVID-19 vaccination</h1>

    <h3>Is the vaccination safe and effective?</h3>
    <p>
      Since every vaccine in Switzerland must be authorised, it has to meet
      stringent safety, efficacy and quality requirements. Swissmedic, the
      Swiss Agency for Therapeutic Products, has carefully assessed and
      authorised the mRNA vaccines against COVID-19. They are safe and
      effective. Several tens of thousands of people have received the
      vaccines in clinical trials. They are also safe and effective for the
      elderly and those with chronic illnesses.Since their approval, hundreds
      of millions of people have received these vaccines. Experts will
      continue to monitor the safety and efficacy of the vaccines. The
      benefits of a vaccine must significantly outweigh the risks. Only then
      will the vaccine be recommended in Switzerland.
